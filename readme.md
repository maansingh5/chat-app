Hi!
I've made this very simple application to showcase some of my web development skills.
The Application has been made quite quickly so the comments and the code structure may not be the best. 
This applications runs in a node.js environment.
Made using express and socket.io
Please install all dependencies before running. - 'npm install'
To run the app - 'npm start'
Runs locally on - http://localhost:4000/# chat-app
